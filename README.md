# Wordle Bot

Since Wordle is the next big game people are playing right now, I decided to make a Bot to solve my daily wordle problems.

## Concepts

All of the concepts I used was from 3Blue1Brown's YouTube video on Wordle.

- Information Bit Theory
- Entropy

## Coding

I used Python for the whole project and used Selenium to help with web scraping.

- You must install Selenium and Python to run this program

## Description

Note: All the possible words are hard coded inside and possible color result combinations and expected value for all possible words are already computed.

1. Run 'python wordle.py' in the terminal
2. The program will solve wordle in a serparate browser while giving you information in the terminal
3. The program will show a list of words that give the highest information by Information Bit Theory and Entropy.
4. When the program is done, it will tell you the Wordle of the day
