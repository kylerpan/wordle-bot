# Wordle Bot
Since Wordle is the next big game people are playing right now, I decided to make a Bot to solve my daily wordle problems.

## Concepts
All of the concepts I used was from 3Blue1Brown's YouTube video on Wordle. 
* Information Bit Theory
* Entropy 

## Description
Note: All the possible words are hard coded inside and possible color result combinations and expected value for all possible words are already computed.  
1. The program will show a list of words that give the highest information by Information Bit Theory and Entropy.
2. The program asks the user for a valid 5 letter word along with the color results for that word.
3. The program will also show a list the remaining possible words based on the user inputs. 
4. The program will repeat all steps until there is only one remaining word.
